`rack-test-rest` is an extension to `rack-test` that when combined with
`Test::Unit` simplifies the process of unit testing properly
designed RESTful API's.

# Installation
    $ gem install rack-test-rest

# Use

`rack-test-rest` extends `rack-test` with a set of higher-level methods that
perform _CRUD_ operations against resources through a RESTful API that conforms
to best practices and validates that they respond correctly.
It's designed to be mixed into a subclass of `Test::Unit::Testcase`
that is testing a specific resource e.g.:

      class GaugeTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
        include Rack::Test::Methods
        include Rack::Test::Rest

        def setup
          @rack_test_rest = {
            #:debug => true,
            :root_uri => "/v1/metrics",
            :resource => "gauges",
            :extension => ".json" #other possibilities ".xml", "_json",".html", etc
          }
        end

        def test_create
          create_resource(:name => "foo")
          create_resource(:code => 422, :name => "foo")
        end

        def test_read
          create_resource(:name => "foo")

          gauge = read_resource(:id => "foo")
          assert gauge['name'] == "foo"
        end

        def test_update
          create_resource(:name => "foo", :description => "bar")

          update_resource(:id => "foo", :description => "baz")

          gauge = read_resource(:id => "foo")
          assert gauge['description'] == "baz"
        end

        def test_delete
          create_resource(:name => "foo")
          delete_resource(:id => "foo")
          read_resource(:code => 404, :id => "foo")
        end

`rack-test-rest` exploits _convention over configuration_ to minimize the amount of work
required to test any particular resource. You need only specify `:root_uri` and `:resource`
in your test setup (through the `@rack_test_rest` instance variable). These are combined
to create either the URI for creating/indexing resources or the URI for a particular resource:

    :root_uri + '/' + :resource + :extension
    :root_uri + '/' + :resource + '/' + params[:id].to_s + :extension

Currently JSON is the only supported response Content-Type.

## `create_resource(params={})`

Performs a POST to with any specified parameters to `:root_uri/:resource:extension`
and ensures that it returns `201`. Returns the string value found in the response's
`Location` header.

## `read_resource(params={})`

Performs a GET with any specified parameters and validates that it returns `200`.
If `:id` is specified the GET is performed against a singular resource i.e.
`:root_uri/:resource/:id:extension`. In the absence of `:id` the GET is performed
as an index operation against `:root_uri/:resource:extension`. Returns parsed
JSON of the response body on a `200`.

## `update_resource(params={})`

Requires an :id parameter. Performs a PUT against `:root_uri/:resource/:id:extension`
with any other specified parameters and asserts that it returns `204`.

## `delete_resource(params={})`

Requires an :id parameter. Performs a DELETE against `:root_uri/:resource/:id:extension`
and asserts that it returns `204`.

## Testing invalid input

Any of the CRUD operations can be altered to check that invalid input is properly
detected and returns the correct error code by specifying `:code` as a parameter
e.g.
    create_resource(:code => 422, :name => duplicate_name)
    read_resource(:code => 404, :id => invalid_id)

## Debugging
The point of unit tests is to surface and fix defects and/or regressions in your code
in the lab rather than than in production. When your tests fail you can include
`:debug => true` to instruct `rack-rest-test` to verbosely log to STDOUT the individual
HTTP requests it's performing and the results of each.

## Pagination
`rack-test-rest` also supports randomized tests for paginated resources assuming you follow
the [standard pagination scheme](http://dev.librato.com/v1/pagination). All you need supply it
with is a block it can use to generate unique parameters for populating the resources prior
to pagination tests. You can specify `:count` to control how many records are created and
paginated through (defaults to 512) and `:length` to specify the maximum number of resources
that a single index operation may return (defaults to 100).

    def test_gauge_pagination
      @db.run("DELETE FROM gauges")
      paginate_resource(){ |id| {:name => "foo_#{id}", :description => "gauge #{id}"} }
    end
